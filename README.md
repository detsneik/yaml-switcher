# YAML Switcher for Obsidian

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that allows you to quickly modify YAML frontmatter properties in your notes using keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- **Quick YAML Modification**: Change frontmatter property values with keyboard shortcuts.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Add, edit, and remove shortcuts according to your needs.
- **Fully Customizable**: Configure the property, value, and keyboard shortcut for each action.
- **Text & List Support**: Explicit support for both text properties and list properties in YAML format.
- **Automatic Shortcut Capture**: Directly press the desired keys to easily assign keyboard shortcuts.
- **Robust Command System**: Improved implementation that prevents issues with persistent keyboard shortcuts.
- **Automatic Names**: Smart generation of shortcut names based on YAML property and value.

## Usage

1. Install the plugin from the Obsidian plugin store or manually.
2. Configure your shortcuts in the plugin settings section.
3. Use keyboard shortcuts to quickly modify YAML properties in your notes.

## Example Configuration

The plugin comes with a default configuration to manage a "status" property with three possible values: "todo", "doing", and "done", each with its own keyboard shortcut:

| YAML Property | Shortcut | Value | Shortcut Name |
| ------------- | -------- | ----- | ------------- |
| status        | alt+1    | todo  | Status: todo |
| status        | alt+2    | doing | Status: doing |
| status        | alt+3    | done  | Status: done |

## Use Cases

- **Task Management**: Quickly change the status of your tasks between "to do", "in progress", and "completed".
- **Note Tagging**: Assign categories, priorities, or tags to your notes with keyboard shortcuts.
- **Custom Workflows**: Adapt the plugin to your own knowledge management and organization system.

## Manual Installation

1. Download the `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` files.
2. Create a folder called `yalm-switcher` in your Obsidian vault's plugins folder (`VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/`).
3. Place the downloaded files in this folder.
4. Enable the plugin in Obsidian's settings.

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings > Community Plugins > YAML Switcher.
2. Add, edit, or remove shortcuts according to your needs.
3. For each shortcut, configure:
   - **YAML Property**: The key of the property you want to modify.
   - **Value**: The value to be assigned to the property.
   - **Name**: Automatically generated based on property and value, but can be customized if desired.
   - **Keyboard Shortcut**: The key combination to activate the shortcut. You can type it manually or use the "Capture Shortcut" button to detect the keys you press.
   - **Property Type**: Choose between "Text" (plain text value) or "List" (YAML list format).
   - **Allow Multiple Values**: For list properties, you can choose whether to replace existing values or add to them.

## What's New in Version 0.1.0

- **Enhanced List Management**: Separated list formatting from multiple values behavior
- **Three Property Types**: Now you can choose between Text, List (Single value), or List (Multiple values)
- **Better Control**: Lists can now have a single value (replacing previous values) or allow multiple values (adding to existing values)
- **Clearer Interface**: The UI now shows whether a list property allows multiple values or not
